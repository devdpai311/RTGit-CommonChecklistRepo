  - [ ] Does the V&amp;V Plan plan the validation on the basis of calibration data, operating environments, and vehicle variants and is this documented?

  - [ ] Is the defined selection of the verification methods (SW, HW and System) from the methods recommended in ISO 26262 tables according to the assigned ASILs, documented and is there a rationale given?

  - [ ] Does the V&amp;V Plan plan for checking compliance of each functional and technical safety requirements with its specification and ASIL classification? Aspects are:<br />
- correctness<br />
- completeness<br />
- timing / performance<br />

  - [ ] Is the test equipment monitored by a quality system?

  - [ ] Does the test environment for software unit testing described in the V&amp;V-Plan correspond as far as possible to the target environment? If the software unit testing is not carried out in the target environment, have the differences in the source and object code, and the differences between the test environment and the target environment, been analysed in order to specify additional tests on the target environment during the subsequent test phases?

  - [ ] Is a review of the results of the testing planned?

  - [ ] Are the Entry and Exit Criteria defined for each test?

  - [ ] In case of previous reviews:<br />
- Are all identified issues solved?<br />
- Was it performed by adequate person(s)?

  - [ ] Do the safety analyses report the compliance of the assigned safety goal or requirement?

  - [ ] Do the SA cover all functional safety goals?

  - [ ] If applicable: Did identified weaknesses of the safety concept lead to an updated version of the safety concept and were corresponding measures defined in the System, HW or SW development?

- [ ] Confidence in the use of software tools

  - [ ] Have all tools been documented that were used in the project?

  - [ ] Is the classification and if applicable qualification completed for the identified tools?<br />
If they are not completed, are there corrective measures and responsibilities defined for a subsequent qualification?

  - [ ] Is the selection of the classes of tool impact (TI) and of the tool error detection (TD) reasonable and comprehensible?

  - [ ] Is the qualification result documented as expected by ISO 2626-8, Clause 11?<br />
This includes:<br />
a) the unique identification and version number of the software tool<br />
b) the maximum Tool Confidence Level for which the software tool is classified together with a reference to its evaluation analysis<br />
c) the pre-determined maximum ASIL, or specific ASIL, of any safety requirement which might be violated if the software tool is malfunctioning and produces corresponding erroneous output,<br />
d) the configuration and environment for which the software tool is qualified,<br />
e) the person or organization who carried out the qualification,<br />
