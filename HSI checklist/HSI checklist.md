# Task List for HSI checklist - v1.0

- [ ] <strong>Generic questions : Formalities</strong>

  - [ ] Is the document written in its proper template?<br />
(if not: Is the reason known?)

  - [ ] Does the document has its proper ID, title, version history (version nr. and date), author(s), status?

- [ ] <strong>Generic questions : Completeness (generic)</strong>

  - [ ] Are all chapters provided with intended contents?

  - [ ] Are there any unresolved TBD&#39;s or TO DO&#39;s?

  - [ ] Does the document reflect every relevant requirement of the HRS/SRS/SysRS? Are the corresponding links available (traceability)?

- [ ] <strong>Generic questions : Clarity</strong>

  - [ ] Is the document sufficient clear and understandable by all intended readers?

  - [ ] Are all abbreviations and technical terms defined and clear?

  - [ ] Are the statements sufficiently concise stated (i.e. no unnecessary complicated and long sentences)?

- [ ] <strong>Generic questions : Consistency</strong>

  - [ ] Is the document free of any ambiguous or inconsistent statements?

  - [ ] Is the terminology used consistently? (i.e. the same item is always referred with the same term)?

  - [ ] Is the content&#39;s consistency given between the HSI specification and ist superordinate documents ?&nbsp;

- [ ] <strong>Generic questions : Correctness</strong></p>

<p>Is the document free of obviously wrong or superseded statements?

- [ ] <strong>Completeness (detailed aspects) : Checklist for each stated requirement</strong>

  - [ ] <strong>Verifiable: </strong>Can an acceptance criteria or test be given that un-ambiguously can verifiy the correct implementation of the requirement?&nbsp; (Note: This criteria applies for functional requirements, not for qualities)

  - [ ] Does the HSI specification include all hardware components and modules, that are controlled by software and hardware resources that support the execution of software?

  - [ ] Does the HSI specify the operating modes of the hardware components and the relevant configuration paramater?

  - [ ] Does the HSI specification include a description of shared and exclusive use of hardware resources like memory mapping, allocation of registers, timers, interrupts, I/O ports etc.?

  - [ ] Does the HSI specification include the access mechanism to hardware devices? (like serial, parallel, slave, master/slave..)

  - [ ] Are the relevant diagnostic capabilities of the hardware and their use by the software specified in the HSI specification?

- [ ] <strong>Completeness (detailed aspects)</strong> : <strong>Management of requirements</strong>

  - [ ] <strong>Requirements State</strong>: Do all tracked requirements have a definite state (e.g. in negotiation, accepted, rejected)?

  - [ ] <strong>Baseline Planning:</strong> Are requirements allocated to SW/HW delivery baselines?

- [ ] <strong>Completeness (detailed aspects) : Safety specific questions (ASIL A - D requirements)</strong>

  - [ ] Is the HSI specification consistent with the Technical Safety Concept?

  - [ ] Does the HSI specification include all component hardware devices, that are controlled by software and hardware resources that support the execution of software?

  - [ ] Does the HSI specification include the relevant operating modes of hardware devices and the relevant configuration parameters?

  - [ ] Does the HSI specification include the hardware features that ensure the independence between elements and that support software partitioning?

  - [ ] Does the HSI specification include a description of shared and exclusive use of hardware resources like memory mapping, allocation of registers, timers, interrupts, I/O ports etc.?

  - [ ] Does the HSI specification include the access mechanism to hardware devices? (like serial, parallel, slave, master/slave..)

  - [ ] Does the HSI specify use of modules and timing constraints?

  - [ ] Are the relevant diagnostic capabilities of the hardware and their use by the software specified in the HSI specification?
