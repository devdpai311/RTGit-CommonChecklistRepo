# Task List for HW Requirements Specification - v1.0

- [ ] Is the HW requirement clearly stated? If no, is the assumption for the requirement documented?

- [ ] Is the HW requirement feasible/ implementable( considering solution fitness in design, cost, effort, resources, &hellip;)?

- [ ] Is the HW requirement verifiable? And if the verification method is identified in the DOORS? (e.g. WCCA, Simulation, or DVer testing)

- [ ] Is HW requirement (HRS) traceable to and consistent with system requirement(s) (SysRS), customer requirement(s), Change Request (CR), Defect Reports or the HW-FMEA?
