Tip/Example:<br />
<em>Do not use adjectives,use numbers instead.<br />
e.g. With voltages greater than 16.5 V an overvoltage error has to be put down in the fault storage.</em>

  - [ ] Is the requirement not interpretable in more than one way<br />
Tip/Example:<br />
Do not use relative sentences. Do not use indefinite articles.<br />
e.g. In case of an error a plausibility error is put down and the warning lamp is triggered. -&gt; In the case of an error the control device puts down a plausibility error. After the entry of the plausibility error the control device triggers the warning lamp.

  - [ ] Is the requirement consistenly described between internal requirements or several work products (higher/lower-level documents).<br />

states that &bdquo;A and B&ldquo; occur simultaneously

  - [ ] Is the requirement described correctly such that both requirements provider and requirements receiver have the same understanding of it.<br />

correctness.

  - [ ] Is the requirement descrobed such that it can be understood at first sight<br />
